ROZE is a voice assistant that is intended for use in driving based contexts. It converts all incoming notifications to an audio based format, this prevents the driver from having to pick up their phone to check updates.

The goal with this application was to reduce vehicular accidents caused due to distracted driving.

This is a project I developed as a part of my IB MYP Personal Project _circa 2018_
